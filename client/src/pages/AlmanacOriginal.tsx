        content={`The Sonoran Desert covers a large area in the southwest U.S. and northwest México. It is a land of extreme temperatures: high evaporation, low rainfall, and little water. It can be too hot, too cold, too wet, and too dry! These extremes make living here a unique experience.

It is a harsh environment, but these conditions have created one of the most biodiverse landscapes in the world. It has also been home to native people for thousands of years. Humans are an important part of this diversity; inhabitants of the Tucson Basin have cultivated and domesticated crops for at least 4,000 years. If you are currently residing in the Tucson Basin, you are sitting on the ancestral lands of the O'odham people. This acknowledgement calls us to recognize and honor the people who have cared for the land through generations, and learn how to be better stewards of the places we inhabit.

Over the last few centuries, people from around the world have made the Sonoran Desert their home, bringing with them new foods, technologies, and traditions further enriching this complex environment. As we move forward into an uncertain future, let's celebrate this diversity; let's allow our unique natural and cultural heritage to teach us how to live in harmony with our land.`}

        author="Nacho Littleagle Flores, Tohono O'odham Tribal Member"
        content={`There is not just one traditional O'odham Calendar. Different O'odham communities each have calendars serving different purposes; there are medicinal calendars and ceremonial calendars. The O'odham calendar at Manzo Elementary School is an agricultural calendar, and the nearby O'odham village of Chuk-son was an agricultural community on the Santa Cruz River.

The modern O'odham Calendar uses Gregorian Calendar months, but due to climate change, the months no longer align with the O'odham traditional calendar. O'odham New Year falls during Summer Solstice with the Wine Festival and welcomes in the Monsoon Season. Because of global warming, monsoon rains don't always come. There are shorter winters and longer summers. Historically, harvesting native foods in the fall happened for more than a month. Now it is much shorter.

The traditional O'odham calendar lets the O'odham people know what to do throughout year. If you're a potter you know when to get your clay; if you're a basket weaver you know when to harvest yucca leaves and bear grass. The calendar helps maintain culture, identity, language, and the O'odham creation story.`}

        id="monsoon"
        title="Monsoon Season"
        description="Local indigenous people use the dramatic monsoon to mark the beginning of the year, a season that accompanies a change in wind direction that moves warm tropical air to the Sonoran desert region. Typically spanning July through September, the summer monsoon rains bring up to half of Arizona's yearly rainfall and are a welcome respite from the dry heat of early summer. Brief, intense storms move quickly over the landscape, often flooding roads and filling creeks and rivers. The rains bring a second wildflower bloom and a second breeding season for many desert animals. Butterflies emerge with the rains, and both amphibians and reptiles are active, particularly on rainy evenings. Prickly pear fruit begins to ripen in August. Bats move south following the agave bloom, and bird migrations reach their peak in September."

        title="Water Harvesting"
        author="Amy Flores & Mark Reynolds"
        content={`One not-so-new technique we cherish during the monsoon is rainwater harvesting. Before municipal water was readily available to residents, native people used rainwater and earthworks to water their gardens. The Tohono O'odham people traditionally utilized ak-chin farming, a method that involved directing rainwater down hillsides into irrigation channels and earthen basins for storage, channeling surface runoff into the root zone of trees, and growing crops on flood plains.

There are many factors to consider when building a large sustainable rain garden and the learning can be extremely rich for students. However, rainwater harvesting can be as simple as knowing how much rainwater your area gets and using it wisely. You can start by simply digging a shallow basin around a fruit tree or a swale, or gradual ditch, to divert water to your plants.

There are two types of rainwater harvesting: active and passive. Active rainwater systems actively collect, filter, store and reuse water, such as a cistern or collection tank. Passive harvesting systems allow rainwater to be naturally absorbed into the land using berms and basins.

Through carefully derived mathematical formulas, we can calculate how much water can be collected in a year:
Collection Area (ft²) × Annual Rainfall (ft) × 7.48 (gal/ft³) = Annual Water Budget (gal)

Once you know how much water you can collect in a year (your annual water budget), you need to know the annual water demands of each plant you want to grow. For example, an orange tree in Tucson needs about 7,000 gallons a year.`}

Though it is generally a dry season, unseasonable rains sometimes fall in October, and by November, snow has typically fallen at high elevations. If there is enough rain, winter annuals begin to grow and many desert plants produce fruit, including barrel cactus, hackberries, and wolfberries, providing food for overwintering birds. Reptiles become fairly inactive over this period, and wintering hawks arrive. Fall is an ideal time to turn over warm weather gardens and plant cool season crops such as winter greens, root vegetables, garlic, onions, and broccoli before the first frost arrives."

They are easy to care for, like full sun, and not too rich soil. A school garden favorite, marigolds persist through the summer heat and even act as pest deterrents in the garden.

Marigolds play a central role in Día de Los Muertos, one of the most important Mexican national holidays, now celebrated throughout Latin America and the US. Día de Los Muertos merges Aztec rituals and Catholicism celebrating the return of the deceased. Although it is an important and solemn event, it is not a time for sadness but rejoicing the return of loved ones. The deceased are honored with food and flowers prepared by their family. Relatives spread the cempasúchil (marigold) around the ofrenda, or altar, to guide souls to the banquet that awaits them.`}

Decomposition can be accomplished in various ways, but we commonly recommend a compost pile or worm bin! Worm bins are a good beginner option because they are contained and compost quickly, while compost piles require you to maintain a fine balance between greens (fresh waste materials high in nitrogen), and browns (dead, dry material that provides carbon).

Your compost pile should have about 30 times the amount of browns that it does greens, by weight. You can achieve this by adding dry mulch and alternating layers of organic materials of different-sized particles. Remember to add water to your compost to encourage decomposition!
